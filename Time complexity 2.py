# Example 1

print("Hi there!") #c1 time to complete

#Example 2
print("Hi") # c1 time to complete
print("there") #c2 time to complete
print("!") # c3 time to complete

# total time to complete  = c1 + c2 + c3 = C
# time complexity  = O(1) or O(C)


# Example 3
n = 3 # c1 time to complete
for i in range(0, n): # n
    print("Heloo Everyone !") #c2 time to complete

# Time complextity = c1 + c2*n
#                  = O(n)
